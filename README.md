# Guides

This is a set of short guides to processes I find myself doing in every new machine, or I spent some time figuring out and want to preserve.

>**_Disclaimer:_** It is by no means something I invented, nor is it supposed to be the best way to achieve things. It is just a short documentation of the setups I ended up using.

It contains:

- [SSH customization guide](ssh_customization/README.md)
- [Generate a point clould from a Blender object](blender2pointCloud/README.md)
